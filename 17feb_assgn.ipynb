    "    - Usability : The data it stores is unstructed which increases its usability in diffrerent \n",
    "        circumstances.\n",
    "    - Scalability : As any form of data can be stored in a MongoDB , hence its scalable with new \n",
    "    form of data being originating every succesive days in this developing world.\n",
    "    - Connectivity : As It is cloud-based software hence db can be easily connected with python \n",
    "    and remote command can be executed easily in MongoDB."
